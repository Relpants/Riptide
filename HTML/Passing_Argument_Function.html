<!--Elements like <div> are block elements in HTML (and XHTML), which means
they’re automatically set off on their own lines (much like a header, such as
<h1>). Sometimes, you might not want the data you fetch by using Ajax techniques
to appear on its own line — you might want it to appear on the same
line as other text, such as text that explains what your data means (for example,
“Record number: “, or something similar). To place text inline in realtime,
you can use a <span> element instead of a <div>-->



<html>
	<head>
		<title>Using Arguments</title>

		<script language="javascript">
			function displayText(text){
				document.getElementById("targetDiv").innerHTML = text;
			}
		</script>

		<body onload="displayText('You\'re using Javascript.')">

			<h1>Using a Div</h1>
			<div id ="targetDiv">
			</div>

		</body>
</html>
